Instead what if the last two answers need to be below the median? Really it would be better if it didn't care how long over the median you were. Just that you were. And then put a known card at least every other card. 

Could think about just throwing an random card from each pile (above median, below median).
So
- above median card
- below median card

and grab 5 below medians at a time. and that would be a "level"

Also, need to make sure that the algo does not punish when it just sits there and you start again.

Currently there is a bug where if the answer is incorrect but less than the median, it is "counted" as less than the median even though it was incorrect. Happens more often than you would think.
